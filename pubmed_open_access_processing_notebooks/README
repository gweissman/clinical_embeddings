This directory contains the notebooks used to build the OA_CR corpus and the associated word embeddings. It also represents the general procedure used for building all of our corpora. 

The Multiword_Expression directory contains a pickle object of the MWEs we used for building all of our corpora. A detailed explanation of our method can be found in the preprint and the implementation can be found in the Curated_Multi_Word_Expression_Identification notebook.
